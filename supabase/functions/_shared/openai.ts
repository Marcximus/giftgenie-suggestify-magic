1. Be SPECIFIC products from well-known, quality brands
2. STRICTLY stay within the specified budget range - this is critical
3. Be currently available from reputable retailers
4. Perfectly match the recipient's interests and preferences
5. Include complete product names with brand, model, and key feature
6. Be diverse within the category (avoid suggesting multiple similar items)

CRITICAL RULES:
- Never suggest generic items (e.g., "golf clubs" â†’ "Titleist TSi3 Driver with HZRDUS Smoke RDX 60 Shaft")
- Include specific model numbers or editions when relevant
- Suggest items from recognized brands
- Ensure each suggestion is unique and serves a different purpose
- IMPORTANT: Spread suggestions across the entire specified budget range
- Make sure every suggestion fits within the budget - no exceptions

Format each suggestion as: "Brand Model/Edition with Key Feature"
Example: "Sony WH-1000XM5 Noise Cancelling Headphones with LDAC"

IMPORTANT: Your response must be a valid JSON array of strings. Do not include any explanatory text outside the array.
Example response format:
["Product 1 name", "Product 2 name", "Product 3 name"]

Remember: Focus on relevance and quality. Each suggestion should be thoughtful and match both interests and budget.`
