2. Product Sections (CRITICAL UNIQUENESS REQUIREMENTS):
   - Create EXACTLY ${numItems} HIGHLY UNIQUE product recommendations

     * Limited edition or special versions of products
     * Innovative new products from emerging brands
     * Unique combinations of features not commonly found together
     * Products with interesting origin stories or unique manufacturing processes
   - Each section separated by: <hr class="my-8">
   - Keep product titles SHORT and SPECIFIC (max 7 words)
   - Format product titles as: <h3>[SPECIFIC PRODUCT NAME]</h3>
   - Examples of good unique titles:
     * "Ember Temperature Control Smart Mug"
     * "Bellroy Tokyo Totepack Limited Edition"
     * "Oura Smart Ring Heritage Edition"

3. Content Structure:
   - Write 2-3 engaging paragraphs (200-350 words) for each product
   - Start with what makes this product unique
   - Follow with specific features and benefits
   - End with why it's an exceptional gift choice
   - Use emoji indicators:
     üéÅ for product uniqueness
     ‚≠ê for special features
     üíù for gift-giving benefits

4. Features Format:
   - Include 3-4 DISTINCTIVE key features for each product
   - Focus on unique aspects that set it apart
   - Format features as:
     <ul class="my-4">
       <li>‚úÖ [Unique Feature 1]</li>
       <li>‚úÖ [Unique Feature 2]</li>
       <li>‚úÖ [Unique Feature 3]</li>
       <li>‚úÖ [Unique Feature 4]</li>
     </ul>

5. Product Image Placement:
   - Each product section should follow:
     1. Product title (H3)
     2. [Space for product image - will be added automatically]
     3. [Space for Amazon button - will be added automatically]
     4. Description paragraphs
     5. Feature list

6. Section Spacing:
   - Start each new product section with: <hr class="my-8">
   - End with a conclusion (200-300 words) summarizing the unique value of each gift
   - Add a final horizontal rule after the conclusion

CRITICAL: Ensure MAXIMUM DIVERSITY in:
- Price points (mix of affordable and premium options)
- Use cases (practical, experiential, educational, entertainment)
