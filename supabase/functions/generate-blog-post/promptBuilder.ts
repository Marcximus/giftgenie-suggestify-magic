     ‚Ä¢ Use proper paragraph breaks for spacing for easier reading and overview

2. Product Sections:

   - CRITICAL: Each product MUST be from a completely different category to ensure variety
   - Categories to consider: Tech, Home, Fashion, Hobby, Beauty, Food, Travel, Pet, Wellness, Entertainment, Sports
   - Each section should be separated by: <hr class="my-8">
   - Product titles MUST include specific brand names and models when applicable

   - Examples of good titles:
     ‚Ä¢ "Sony WH-1000XM5 Wireless Headphones"
     ‚Ä¢ "Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition"
     ‚Ä¢ "Le Creuset Enameled Dutch Oven 5.5qt"
     ‚Ä¢ "Fitbit Charge 6 Fitness Tracker"

3. Content Structure:

   - Use proper paragraph breaks for spacing
   - Start with an introduction paragraph about the product
   - Follow with features and benefits 
   - End with why it makes a great gift
   - Use emoji indicators at the start of key paragraphs:
     üéÅ for product introductions
     ‚≠ê for features and benefits
     üíù for gift-giving benefits
Features Format:
   - Include 2-3 UNIQUE key features for each product as a list

       <li>‚úÖ [Key Feature 1]</li>
       <li>‚úÖ [Key Feature 2]</li>

     </ul>

4. Content Guidelines:
   - Write naturally flowing text that's easy to read
   - Create fun, engaging, informative content that provides value
   - Include a mix of short and medium-length sentences
   - Use transition words to improve flow
   - Include relevant examples and use cases
   - Add personal touches and recommendations
   - If there's a specific occasion in the title:
     ‚Ä¢ Explain why each item is particularly suitable for that occasion
     ‚Ä¢ Include occasion-specific use cases or scenarios
     ‚Ä¢ Reference the occasion in the gift-giving benefits section
   - End with a strong conclusion summarizing key points
   - Leave space before the conclusion with: <hr class="my-8">

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR VARIETY:
- Price ranges should vary across suggestions (mix of budget-friendly and premium options)
- Include a mix of practical, popular and unique/creative gifts
- Target different aspects of the recipient's interests or needs
- Consider both mainstream and unique/niche product options
- Include at least one unexpected but relevant suggestion
- If there's an occasion in the title:
  ‚Ä¢ Ensure at least half the suggestions are particularly relevant to that occasion
  ‚Ä¢ Include both traditional and unique occasion-specific gifts
  ‚Ä¢ Consider the occasion's typical budget range and gift-giving customs

Remember:
- Always include specific brand names and model numbers
- Use complete product names (e.g., "Sony WH-1000XM4 Wireless Noise Cancelling Headphones" instead of just "headphones")
- Include premium or special editions when available
- Ensure items are currently available on Amazon
- Avoid generic descriptions
- Maintain proper paragraph spacing
- Don't include image placeholders or buttons - these will be added automatically
- NEVER write "Key Features:" as a heading - use the emoji indicators and list format directly`
