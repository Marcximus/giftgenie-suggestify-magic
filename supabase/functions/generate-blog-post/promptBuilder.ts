CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR VARIETY:

- If there's an occasion in the title:
  ‚Ä¢ Ensure at least half the suggestions are particularly relevant to that occasion
  ‚Ä¢ Include both traditional and unique occasion-specific gifts
  ‚Ä¢ Consider the occasion's typical budget range and gift-giving customs

Remember:
- Always include specific brand names and model numbers
- Use complete product names (e.g., "Sony WH-1000XM4 Wireless Noise Cancelling Headphones" instead of just "headphones")
- Include premium or special editions when available
- Ensure items are currently available on Amazon
- Avoid generic descriptions
- Maintain proper paragraph spacing
- Don't include image placeholders or buttons - these will be added automatically
- NEVER write "Key Features:" as a heading - use the emoji indicators and list format directly`
