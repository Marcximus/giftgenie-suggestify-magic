   - Include 1-2 emojis per paragraph
   - Add spacing between paragraphs
   - Use <h2> tags for any subheadings needed

2. HTML Formatting Rules:
   - Format all paragraphs as: <p>Your text here</p>
   - Format main section headings as: <h2>Section Title</h2>
   - Format product titles as: <h3>No. [NUMBER]: [PRODUCT NAME]</h3>
   - Format unordered lists as: <ul><li>List item</li></ul>
   - Format ordered lists as: <ol><li>List item</li></ol>
   - Use proper paragraph spacing with a blank line between elements
   - Keep all text justified-aligned except the title which should be center
   - Do not use any custom CSS or inline styles

3. Product Recommendations:
   - Create EXACTLY ${numItems} recommendations
   - Write 200-300 words per product
   - Add 2-3 emojis per product section
   - Format each product section as:
     <h3>No. [NUMBER]: [PRODUCT NAME]</h3>
     <p>[Product description with emojis]</p>

4. Conclusion:
   - Use spacing first
   - End with a funny conclusion about 100-300 words wrapped in <p> tags
   - Include a final emoji-filled sign-off

Style Guidelines:
- Use a conversational, friendly tone

IMPORTANT: 
- Maintain consistent HTML structure throughout
- Make product names specific for accurate Amazon matching
- Focus on premium/high-quality items
- Maintain humor throughout
- Use emojis effectively but don't overdo it
- Remember to COUNT DOWN from ${numItems} to 1
- Do not add any custom classes or styles
- Keep the HTML structure clean and semantic`
